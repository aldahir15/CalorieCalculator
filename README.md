# Calorie Calculator

Welcome to my calorie calculator. This Ruby on Rails application was built with Bootstrap for styling.
Key points of this application:
* Uses the Mifflin-St Jeor research model for calculating your BMR
* Gives you a daily calorie intake based on your activity level and your goals (based on how many calories you wish to lose per month)
* Also tells you your daily TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
